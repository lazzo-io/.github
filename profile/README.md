# We are Lazzo 🚀

### Our Story
Began in 2019 in Monterrey, México. After years in the software development industry, we realized that helping our friends to create their websites was a recurrent revenue. After some time we found that nobody was integrating in a good way the software processes and tech tools to websites.

#### Our Mission 🎯
Bringing the power and knowledge of big tech companies to a lagging industry like web design.

#### Our Vision 🤩
Digitize companies in Latin America and North America with the development of modern websites, helping to remove communication barriers between our clients and their users.

We believe everyone deserves to have a website or online store. Our goal is to help businesses with their sales workflow and web marketing strategies with our technical skills. We are the solution offshore to avoid the financial barriers to develop websites that will cost around +20k USD.

Today, we're proud to empower individuals and business owners around the world. Innovation and simplicity makes us happy. Everyone deserves a great website, and we're excited to be part of.
